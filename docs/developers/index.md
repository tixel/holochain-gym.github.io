Welcome!

Nice to see you decided to work on your Holochain skills. We, at Holochain Gym, would love to help you get in shape. We will start with some easy and basic exercises and build up from there until you have enough skill, strength and stamina to build your own holochain apps.

The first exercises will focus on everything you need know to build your first Zome and your first DNA.
Don't know what Zomes and DNA are? [Checkout this page first](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/concepts/2_application_architecture/)  
  
After that we will challenge you to go to the next level: the intermediate exercises.
<!-- tell more about the other sections as soons as they start forming --> 

Well, let's get you setup so you can start your workout.
Head over to [setup](/developers/requirements/setup), on the left, to make sure you are fully equipped to start training.
When you are ready, start with the [first exercise](/developers/beginner/entries).

Eat healthy and good luck!
